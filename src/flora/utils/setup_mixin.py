class RequiredSetup(ABC):
    """
    Template Method pattern for deferred component initialization.

    Provides consistent setup/teardown lifecycle for FLUX components that need
    runtime initialization (device placement, network connections, etc.).

    Pattern enforces clean separation:
    - External callers use `setup()` (public interface)
    - Classes override `_setup()` (private implementation)
    - Built-in duplicate setup protection with state tracking

    Usage pattern:
    ```python
    class MyComponent(SetupMixin):
        def _setup(self):
            # Runtime initialization logic here
            pass

    # External usage
    component = MyComponent()
    component.setup()  # Calls _setup() internally
    component.setup()  # Subsequent calls ignored
    ```
    """

    @property
    def is_ready(self) -> bool:
        """True if component has completed setup and is ready for operations."""
        if not hasattr(self, "_setup_complete"):
            self._setup_complete = False
        return self._setup_complete

    def setup(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """
        Initialize component with duplicate setup protection.

        Template method that calls _setup() if not already initialized.
        Subsequent calls are ignored with a notification message.

        Args:
            *args: Positional arguments passed to _setup()
            **kwargs: Keyword arguments passed to _setup()
        """
